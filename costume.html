  <h2>Dear Mr. Schjeldhal,</h2>

<p>I hope this finds you very well.</p>

<p>First of all, thank you so much for sharing your writing with the world. We're damn lucky to get to read it.</p>

<p>I've been meaning to write you for a few months now, ever since your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/10/25/moma-ps1-greater-new-york-confirms-rather-than-surprises" style="color: black">"Who's We?"</a> piece on PS1 made me leap out of my seat with joy. Those words captured a sentiment I'd been feeling for a while, and I wanted to show you just how much they hit me right where I live.</p>

<p>May I?</p>

<p>Back on Halloween in 2019, I went to the Whitney's costume party. This one was mine:</p>

  <p>At one point, I stood against a wall of the Rachel Harrison exhibit.</p>

  <p>After a moment, the other visitors became quite interactive.</p>

  <p>Here's what they were reading:</p>

  <p>Your writing is far more articulate than this dilettante's flirtation with performance art. Still, I hope you get a kick out of it.

<p>Thank you again for all your work. Please know yours is the first name I look for in every issue.<p>

<p>Cheers,
<br>Max</p>
<br>
<p>P.S. My girlfriend gave me your latest book for Christmas, and we've been loving reading it aloud a piece or two at a time. Her 36th birthday is tomorrow, beginning with a visit to the Jasper Johns show in the morning. Awful short notice, and you've already seen it besides...but if you were so inclined, I know she'd be thrilled to have you join us.</p>
