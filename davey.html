    (Intro)

    C  Am  G  F
     
    C  Am  F Dm C
      
      
    Verse 1:
        
    C               Am
    In the heart of old PA
    G                  F
    On the hottest ever summer day
    C                          Am
    Somethin' happened at the swimming hole
        F            Dm     C
    But Davey won't tell a soul
      
    C                      Am
    There's a cliff there against the sky
    G                    F
    Fifty feet up and at least as wide
    C                        Am
    Dave would climb up and then he would dive
          F          Dm        C        
    His guts were tougher than iron

    C                  Am
    On that day he said he had a plan
    G                        F
    He climbed and jumped and he threw out his hands
    C              Am
    Hit the water, kicked and he swam
        F      Dm        C
    He hit the water and swam
      
    
    Chorus:
      
    C                    Am
    Davey dove deep that day
            G                  Fm
    Yeah he tried to touch the bottom
                          C          Am
    When he came back to breathe, he said
              G            Fm
    That the water almost got him
                C          Am
    Got him to stay down deep
          G                 Fm
    Where no one would ever find him
                         C          Am
    But he came back for me, so he said
      C
    Anyway
      
    
    Verse 2:
      
      C               Am
    Drying off, we went back to town
    G                      F
    Folks saw Dave and they gathered 'round
    C                    Am
    Asked him, "How high was it today?"
          F      Dm     C
    But Davey wouldn't say
    
    C                        Am
    He played it coy with a wink and a smile
    G                 F
    He never did tell just how high
    C                  Am
    To get the story, they didn't know
        F      Dm       C
    To ask him just how low
      
    
    Chorus:
      
    C                    Am
    Davey dove deep that day
            G                     Fm
    Yeah he must have touched the bottom
                          C          Am
    When he came back to breathe, he said
              G            Fm
    That the water almost got him
                C          Am
    Got him to stay down deep
          G              Fm
    Where nobody'd ever find him
                         C          Am
    But he came back for me, so he said
      C
    Anyway
