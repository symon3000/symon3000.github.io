  <h2> Hi Ryan,</h2>

  <p>I hope this finds you well. Oli's shared a bit about the exciting work you're doing at Autograph, and I look forward to connecting with you on Thursday to hear more about it.<br><br>In the meantime, thanks for taking a look at some of my work. I thought I'd start with a few examples of my professional editorial efforts, but please feel free to <a href="#fun" style="color:black">skip ahead to the extracurricular stuff</a>.</p>

  <h3>Ritani</h3>

  <p>First up: a Brand Voice project for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ritani.com" style="color: black">Ritani</a>, a DTC jeweler that was undergoing a complete rebrand at the time. I served as copywriter on this one, working hand in glove with a strategy team.</p>

  <h3>Bud Light</h3>

  <p>Next, here's some Brand Architecture / Innovation Strategy content I helped create for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.budlight.com" style="color: black">Bud Light</a>. In collaboration with a research team, we explored customer territories and occasions ("Palate Maps" and "Demand Moments"), and I penned the voices behind each.</p>

  <h3>Tony Chi</h3>

  <p>When the tonychi studio design firm was undergoing a recent reorganization, I was tapped to lead its Brand Identity & Messaging work, producing the Principles below in anticipation of its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tonychi.com" style="color: black">new website</a>.</p>

  <h3>Citi Ventures</h3>

  <p>In addition to my work with small, boutique brands, I also partner directly with teams at large institutions to lend a hand with their written efforts. On top of the internal marketing content I create for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.citi.com/ventures/" style="color: black">Citi Ventures</a>, I've helmed <a target="_blank" href="https://icg.citi.com/ngl/eppublic/borrower/" style="color: black">UX copy for their external products</a>, and I also serve as the ghost writing one investor's <a target="_blank" href="https://profiles.forbes.com/members/finance/profile/Matt-Carbonara-Managing-Director-Citi-Ventures/f7b97e12-5239-4ede-b27b-8fc788b30807" style="color: black">ongoing Forbes column</a> seen below.</p>

  <h2 id="fun">All right, let's take a look at some fun stuff.</h2>

  <h3>Whitney Museum of American Art</h3>

  <p>I once did a little performance piece at the Whitney Museum, attempting to blend art with artist. Here's me on display, getting viewed by visitors making their way through the space.</p>

  <video playsinline loop autoplay muted src="whitneyImages/timelapse.mp4" type="video/mp4" height=100% width=100%></video>

  <p>This is what they were reading (which I like to think of as a sort of Brand Voice exercise in itself):</p>

  <img id=placard src="whitneyImages/Placard.png" height=100% width=100%>

  <p>It was a wonderful experience.</p>

  <br>
  
  <h3>The Quality Edit</h3>

  <p>During the pandemic, a friend of mine launched <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thequalityedit.com/" style="color: black">a site reviewing DTC brands</a> and asked me if I'd like to try out some products and then post my two cents in public. Here's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thequalityedit.com/articles/glyph-spirits-review" style="color: black">one</a> I wrote about a "molecular whiskey," which definitely put my editorial integrity to the test.</p>

  <br>
  <br>
  
  <h3>The Neurotic Notebook</h3>

  <p>A couple years back, a Parisienne friend asked me to help edit her book of English wordplay. I was proud to see it get published a few months ago, and I loved putting my nominal web-development skills to use by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theneuroticnotebook.com" style="color: black">transposing it to a digital form</a>.</p>

  <h2>Thank you.</h2>

  <p>Thanks again for taking a gander through the above. I'm very much looking forward to meeting you and learning more about Autograph's projects when we chat.</p>

  <p>Cheers,<br>
