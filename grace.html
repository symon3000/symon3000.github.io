  <h2>Grace!</h2>

  <p>Thanks so much for taking a look at some of my work.<br><br>I thought I'd start off with a few examples of my professional editorial efforts, but please feel free to <a href="#fun" style="color:black">skip ahead to the extracurriculars</a>.</p>

  <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.autograph.io" style="color: black">Autograph</a></h3>

  <p id="p1">In my current role as Autograph's Senior Copywriter, I'm proud to serve as the go-to verbal guy for every team at the web3 start-up. Whether I'm crafting campaigns with Marketing, <a href=tagline.gif style="color:black">penning taglines with the C-suite</a>, humanizing the UI with Tech, or <a href=sigex.gif style="color:black">coining new offerings with Product</a>, I always love helping folks find the words they need to say what they mean. Here's a few more of 'em:</p>

  <p>Next up: a Brand Voice project for a DTC jeweler that was undergoing a complete rebrand at the time. I served as copywriter on this one, working hand in glove with a strategy team.</p>

  <p>Here's some Brand Architecture / Innovation Strategy content I helped create for the beloved beer brand. In collaboration with a research team, we explored customer territories and occasions ("Palate Maps" and "Demand Moments"), and I produced the voices behind each.</p>

  <p>In addition to my work with small, boutique brands, I also partner directly with teams at large institutions to lend a hand with their written efforts. On top of the internal marketing content I create for Citi Ventures, I've helmed <a target="_blank" href="https://icg.citi.com/ngl/eppublic/borrower/" style="color: black">UX copy for their external products</a>, and I also serve as the ghost writing one investor's <a target="_blank" href="https://profiles.forbes.com/members/finance/profile/Matt-Carbonara-Managing-Director-Citi-Ventures/f7b97e12-5239-4ede-b27b-8fc788b30807" style="color: black">ongoing Forbes column</a> seen below.</p>

  <h3>Whitney Museum of American Art</h3>

  <p>I once did a little performance piece at the Whitney Museum, attempting to blend art with artist. Here's me on display, getting viewed by visitors making their way through the space.</p>

  <p>This is what they were reading (which I like to think of as a sort of Brand Voice exercise in itself):</p>

  <p>It was a wonderful experience.</p>

  <h3>The Quality Edit</h3>

  <p>During the pandemic, a friend of mine launched <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thequalityedit.com/" style="color: black">a site reviewing DTC brands</a> and asked me if I'd like to try out some products and then post my two cents in public. Here's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thequalityedit.com/articles/glyph-spirits-review" style="color: black">one</a> I wrote about a "molecular whiskey," which definitely put my editorial integrity to the test.</p>

  <h3>The Neurotic Notebook</h3>

  <p>A couple years back, a Parisienne friend asked me to help edit her book of English wordplay. I was proud to see it get published some months ago, and I loved putting my nominal web-development skills to use by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theneuroticnotebook.com" style="color: black">transposing it to a digital form</a>.</p>
