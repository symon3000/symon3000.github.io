  <h2>Hi, Meta I'm Max.</h2>

  <p>Thanks so much for putting out the call to join your team. I'm very excited to put my hat in the ring.<br><br>And thanks for taking the time to look at some of my work below. I thought I'd start off with a few examples of my professional editorial efforts, but please feel free to <a href="#fun" style="color:black">skip ahead to the extracurriculars</a>.</p>

  <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.autograph.io" style="color: black">Autograph</a></h3>

  <p id="p1">In my recent role as Autograph's Senior Copywriter, I was proud to serve as the go-to verbal guy for every team at the a16z-funded start-up: crafting campaigns with Marketing, conducting brand strategy and <a href=tagline.gif style="color:black">penning taglines with the C-suite</a>, humanizing the UI with Tech, <a href=sigex.gif style="color:black">developing new offerings with Product</a>, and more. I loved liaising between multiple teams to help them speak a common language, get on the same page, and find the words they need to say what they mean. Here's a few more of them:</p>

  <p>As an independent creative consultant, I've had the privilege of working directly with founders as they unveil their next endeavor. For the web3-native Decent, I helped the team align business and brand while leveraging a product debut for their recent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.decent.xyz" style="color: black">site-wide revamp</a>.</p>

  <p>Next up: a Brand Voice project for a DTC jeweler that was undergoing a complete rebrand at the time. I served as copywriter on this one, working hand in glove with a strategy team.</p>

  <p>Here's some Brand Architecture / Innovation Strategy content I helped create for the big-name beer brand. In collaboration with a research team, we explored customer territories and occasions ("Palate Maps" and "Demand Moments"), and I wrote the voices behind each.</p>

  <p>In addition to my work with small boutique brands, I also partner directly with teams at large institutions to lend a hand with their verbal needs. On top of the internal marketing content I create for Citi Ventures, I've helmed <a target="_blank" href="https://icg.citi.com/ngl/eppublic/borrower/" style="color: black">UX copy for their external products</a>, and I also serve as the ghost writing one investor's <a target="_blank" href="https://profiles.forbes.com/members/finance/profile/Matt-Carbonara-Managing-Director-Citi-Ventures/f7b97e12-5239-4ede-b27b-8fc788b30807" style="color: black">ongoing Forbes column</a> seen below.</p>

  <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.botornot.lol" style="color: black">Bot or Not</a></h3>

  <p>I'm a big fan of all the amazing developments happening with AI, and I've been having a blast bringing ideas to life with these exciting new toolsets. Thanks to the help of my new virtual pair-programmer friends, I've been building <a target="_blank" href="https://www.botornot.lol" style="color: black">Bot or Not</a> as an interactive thought experiment, exploring the dynamic of digital dialogue while turning the Turing test back on ourselves a bit.</p>

  <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.whitney.org" style="color: black">Whitney Museum of American Art</a></h3>

  <p>I once did a little performance piece at New York City's cultural institution, attempting to blur the line between art and artist. Here's me on display, getting viewed by visitors making their way through the space.</p>

  <p>This is what they were reading (which I like to think of as a sort of Brand Voice exercise in itself):</p>

  <p>It was a wonderful experience.</p>

  <p>During the pandemic, a friend of mine launched a site reviewing DTC brands and asked me to try out some products and post my two cents in public. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thequalityedit.com/articles/glyph-spirits-review" style="color: black">Here's one</a> I wrote about a "molecular whiskey," which definitely put my editorial integrity to the test.</p>

  <p>A couple years back, a Parisienne friend asked me to help edit her book of English wordplay. I was proud to see it get published some months ago, and I loved putting my nominal web-development skills to use by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theneuroticnotebook.com" style="color: black">transposing it to a digital form</a>.</p>
