  <h1>Hi buildspace. I'm Max.</h1>

  <p>Thanks for extending the application window by a day. It just so happened that yesterday my friend Geoff and I came up with an idea for something we want to make, so these extra hours really make all the difference.</p>

  <p>I shared links for our photography work, but I thought you might get a kick out of this little performance art piece of mine, too.</p>

  <p>This was at the Whitney Museum in New York City a few years ago.</p>

  <p>I stood against a wall in one of the gallery spaces.</p>

  <p>After a moment, the other visitors became quite interactive.</p>

  <p>Here's what they were reading:</p>

  <p>It was terrific.</p>

  <p>Thanks for considering us for n+w s4. Hope we get a chance to build together.
  
  <p>Cheers,<br>
  Max Cooper</p>
